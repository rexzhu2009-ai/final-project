1. Project Overview
This program is to simulate a Ontario G1 test. When the program starts, it wil greet the user with a welcome message.
Then a menu will be displayed where the user decides whether to take the G1 test or login as a admin.The program uses variables, arrays, Arraylists, loops, conditionals, user input and more.
--------------------------------------------
2. Greeting message & Main menu
When the program starts, a greeting message is displayed. The user is then shown a menu with the following:
a. Write a G1 Test
b. Login as Admin
Variables used:
String
If else statements
while loops
------------------------------------------
3. Admin login & Admin menu
If login as admin is selected, the user is prompted to enter a password. The entered password is compared to a stored password using conditional statements.
If the password is correct, the admin menu will display these messages:
- Add a question
- Remove a question
Variables used:
String
Arraylist, .add() and .remove()
input validation using loops
-----------------------------------------
4. Question Bank
The program contains two question banks, each with 10 questions from Ontario Driver's Handbook
What the code stores:
- The question text
- Multiple choice options (array)
- Correct answer (character)
Variables:
Arraylist<Question> rulesQuestions
Arraylist<Question> signsQuestions
--------------------------------------
5. Writing the G1 Test
When the user starts the test:
- Questions are selected randomly from each question bank
- A separate Arraylist keeps track of which questions have already been used
- This ensures that no repeated questions appear
Variables used:
Random class
for and while
Arraylist .contains()
-------------------------------------------
6. Displaying Questions & User Input
Each question is displayed with multiple-choice questions. The user answers by entering letters or words.
Input it to be checked so that it is not empty and that it matched a valid option.
Variables used:
Scanner
Conditional Statements
Loops for re-prompting
----------------------------------------
7. Answer Feedback
After each answer, the program immediately tells the user if their answer if correct or incorrect. Then scores are updated
Variables used:
int rulesScore
int signsScore
int totalScore
-----------------------------------------
8. Early Test Termination
After each question, the program checks if the user can still pass the test based in their current score and remaining questions.
If passing is no longer possible,the test end early and the use ris informed that they cannot pass.
Variables used:
Arithmetic variables
Conditionals
-----------------------------------------
9. Final Results
At the end of the test, the program displays:
- Score for each section
- Final score
- Pass or fail result
------------------------------------------
10. Check for errors
Run the code and check for errors.
